Hi! I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher under joint supervision between the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) and Wenge AI Lab. I was affilated in State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems. I received my PhD from CASIA in 2024 and my bachelor's degree from Southwest University in 2019.

My research interests include:
- Alignment of LLM/VLM (RL, interpretablity)
- Safety Assessment of LLM/VLM (Jailbreak, red-teaming)
- Adversarial Robustness (mainly during my Phd period)
